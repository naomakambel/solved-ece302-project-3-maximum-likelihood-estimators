<br>
Overview: In this exercise, you will implement two maximum likelihoodestimators. Put your code in a MATLAB publisher file:

Part 1: Generate random draws from both of the exponential and Rayleigh randomvariables. You can use the EXPRND and RAYRND functions in MATLAB for this.Implement your ML estimators in MATLAB and plot the MSE with respect to # ofobservations. On separate plots, plot the bias and the variance of yourestimators, with respect to the # of observations. Do this for a couple ofvalues of lambda.

Part 2: The data in the .mat file, data.mat, has been drawn from either anexponential distribution, or a Rayleigh distribution.Compute the max-likelihood estimate of the parameter using both. Using yourestimators that you developed in part 2, compute the max-likelihood estimatesof the parameter. Which distribution do you think the data was drawn from?Justify your answer.
